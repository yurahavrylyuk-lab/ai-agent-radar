# Architect Plan

## Active Cycle

- Cycle ID: `GOV-001`
- Revision: `2`
- Status: `REVIEW`
- Revision-2 baseline: `846392643d039f5304e118d7c87fb91c2a1aaed1`
- Original governance baseline: `3a6946fe07ea3838488c789cba4c69718b2ed328`

Valid plan statuses: EMPTY / READY / IN_PROGRESS / REVIEW / COMPLETE / BLOCKED.

`BLOCKED` means work is stopped because of an unresolved obstacle, rejection, or required human decision.

## Revision 1 History

- Builder commit: `71751da70ac15767fe1356dece3d719ee7f460a4`
- Commit message: `docs: define self-improvement handoff protocol`
- Branch: `self-improvement`
- Original baseline: `3a6946fe07ea3838488c789cba4c69718b2ed328`
- Analyst checkpoint: `846392643d039f5304e118d7c87fb91c2a1aaed1`
- Analyst result: `REVISE`
- Architect decision: `REVISE`

The completed revision-1 Builder and human handoff records that the push and validation succeeded; exactly the nine authorized governance documents changed; tests/build/typecheck were `not run — documentation-only scope`; and there were no production code/configuration, Cloudflare, Cron, provider-limit, deployment, provider-call, merge, or production-behavior changes. These execution facts are attributed to that handoff, not inferred from Git alone.

Revision-1 changed files:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/self-improvement/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/self-improvement/ARCHITECT.md`
- `docs/self-improvement/BUILDER.md`
- `docs/self-improvement/ANALYST.md`
- `docs/self-improvement/ARCHITECT_PLAN.md`
- `docs/self-improvement/ANALYST_REVIEW.md`
- `docs/self-improvement/DAILY_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/self-improvement/CHANGELOG.md`

The Analyst observed that `Без назви.md` was absent during review. The human owner later clarified that, after the revision-1 Builder handoff, they intentionally deleted it because it was empty and unrelated. Its absence is not a Builder failure, and there is no current or future preservation, checksum, or recreation requirement.

## Revision 2 Active Correction

### Motivation

Resolve revision-1 governance evidence gaps without changing production behavior or broadening role authority.

### Current Problem

Revision 1 omitted `BLOCKED` from one valid-status declaration, retained completed-work placeholders, did not reconcile the later human deletion clarification, and did not distinguish historical revision-1 evidence from active revision-2 work.

### Proposed Correction

Correct the status declaration and durable handoff evidence in the five approved governance documents while leaving the Analyst checkpoint unchanged.

### Allowed Files

- `docs/self-improvement/ARCHITECT.md`
- `docs/self-improvement/ARCHITECT_PLAN.md`
- `docs/self-improvement/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/self-improvement/DAILY_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/self-improvement/CHANGELOG.md`

### Out of Scope

`ANALYST_REVIEW.md`, all other files, production code/configuration, Cloudflare, Cron, provider limits, secrets, deployments, provider calls, merges, branches, history rewriting, and recreation of the deleted unrelated file.

### Risks

Conflating revisions could allow stale evidence to approve later work; incomplete states could make a blocked cycle appear actionable.

### Safety Constraints

Keep both historical commits separate, preserve role authority and production invariants, and make documentation-only changes on `self-improvement`.

### Required Validation

Inspect full and staged diffs; run `git diff --check` and `git diff --cached --check`; verify only the five allowed paths changed; verify `ANALYST_REVIEW.md` is byte-identical to the revision-2 baseline; check status declarations, revision separation, secrets, and production boundaries. Tests/build/typecheck: `not run — documentation-only scope`.

### Acceptance Criteria

All revision-2 requirements are recorded accurately, the final Builder-side state is REVIEW, no contradictory current statement remains, and no unauthorized file or operational action occurs.

### Builder Instructions

Implement only this correction at the stated baseline. Record the Architect transition REVIEW → READY and Builder transitions READY → IN_PROGRESS → REVIEW. Commit and push normally without rewriting either prior commit.

### Analyst Focus Areas

Verify the exact revision-2 commit and baseline, complete status list, revision separation, historical evidence attribution, deleted-file clarification, allowed paths, unchanged Analyst checkpoint, and absence of production effects.

### Human Approval

Explicitly approved for this bounded documentation-only revision-2 correction.

### Lifecycle and Decisions

- Architect-authorized revision-2 transition: REVIEW → READY.
- Builder transitions: READY → IN_PROGRESS → REVIEW.
- Final Builder-side status: REVIEW.
- Revision-2 Analyst result: pending.
- Revision-2 Architect decision: pending.

## Revision 2 Builder Handoff

- Changed files: the five allowed governance documents listed above.
- Validation: full/staged diff inspection, allowlist and Analyst-checkpoint verification, whitespace and secret checks passed; tests/build/typecheck: `not run — documentation-only scope`.
- Deviations: none.
- Blockers: none.
- Review target: the revision-2 Builder commit created from this handoff; exact SHA is reported after commit creation and must be used by Analyst.
